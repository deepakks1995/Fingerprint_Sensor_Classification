# Fingerprint_Sensor_Classification

VGG and Resnet are used to classify biometric images containing multiple datasets like FCV2002, FVC2004, FVC2006.

Multi Sensor classification was also done combining all the three datasets based on common sensors.

Results were quite good, achieving over 98% accuracy while using training data of over 15% and rest for testing.
